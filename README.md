# schiffbruch.js

Hello!

Here I'm trying to port the retro-style top-down survival game [Schiffbruch](https://www.dplate.de/games/schiffbruch) (Shipwreck)
by [Dirk Plate](https://www.dplate.de/) to JavaScript and HTML 5 for the Web.

If you are Dirk Plate, I hope you are okay with my intentions. If not, then please contact me via Issue.
I enjoyed your game a lot back in the days. Now I want to make it playable again. :)

I'm simply trying to transcribe the C++ code to JavaScript. Changing the DirectX backend to using Web APIs like 2d Canvas or WebAudio.
