# Schiffbruch (Shipwreck)

![Schiffbruch](./gfx/logo-transparent.png)

This is a survival game where you find yourself stranded on a lonely island. Find water and food! Build a shelter to stay at night and finally call attention for potential rescue ships!

The game was [originally](https://www.dplate.de/games/schiffbruch) created by [Dirk Plate](https://www.dplate.de/). This is a web version. If you are Dirk Plate, I hope you are okay with my intentions. If not, then please contact me via Issue. I enjoyed your game a lot back in the days. Now I want to make it playable again. I transcribed the C++ code to JavaScript. Changed the DirectX backend to Canvas 2D and WebAudio. Savegames are stored in your browsers local storage.
